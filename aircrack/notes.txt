try #2

I did these commands in the terminal once the NIC showed up in lsusb and iwconfig.

iw list indicated that my NIC could be put in monitor mode after installing some open source drivers from GitHub

rebooted computer, installed drivers on mac (maybe not necessary, but figured it wouldnâ€™t hurt)





plugged NIC into mac, connected it to linux
ifconfig 
	shows plan information
iw wlan0 set monitor none
	sets wlan0 to monitor mode
iw wlan0 info
	confirms it is in monitor mode
iwconfig
	mode switched from managed to Auto
airmon-ng start wlan0
	monitor mode already enabled, should 		do nothing
airmon-ng check kill
	turns off interfering processes
airodump-ng wlan0
	begins packet dump
